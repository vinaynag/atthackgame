===========
This is the app build for att mobile app hachathon -
education in Palo Alto in the state it was when we
presented it.

To try it out you'd need a server with PHP and MySQL.
Create a database, run schema.txt against it, enter
database credentials into fight.php, update.php and
send.php, enter your server url in the common.js
instead of (server url) placeholders, and you should
be good to go.
